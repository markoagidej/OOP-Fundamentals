1. City Infrastructure Management System
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to apply the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming in Python to build a simulated City Infrastructure Management System. This system will incorporate classes, objects, methods, and data structures to manage different aspects of a city, such as buildings, traffic, and events.

Task 1: Vehicle Registration System

Problem Statement: Create a Python class Vehicle with attributes registration_number, type, and owner. Implement a method update_owner to change the vehicle's owner. Then, create a few instances of Vehicle and demonstrate changing the owner.
Code Example: Provide a basic structure for the Vehicle class without methods.
```python
class Vehicle:
def init(self, reg_num, type, owner):
self.registration_number = reg_num
self.type = type
self.owner = owner
```
Expected Outcome: Completion of the Vehicle class with the update_owner method and a demonstration script showing the creation of Vehicle objects and updating their owners.
Task 2: Event Management System Enhancement

Problem Statement: Extend an existing Event class by adding a feature to keep track of the number of participants. Implement a method add_participant that increases the count and a method get_participant_count to retrieve the current count.
Code Example: Basic Event class without participant tracking.
```python
class Event:
def init(self, name, date):
self.name = name
self.date = date
```
2. Python City Planning Simulator
Objective:
The aim of this assignment is to solidify understanding of Python's Object-Oriented Programming concepts through the development of a simulated city planning system. This system will integrate the use of classes, objects, inheritance, and file handling to manage various city elements like buildings, traffic systems, and public events.

Task 1: File Handling for Building Records

Problem Statement: Implement a system to handle building records using file operations. Create a Building class and write a script to save and load building details to and from a file.
Code Example: Skeleton of the Building class.
```python
class Building:
def init(self, name, floors):
self.name = name
self.floors = floors
# Methods to save to file and load from file
```
Expected Outcome: A complete Building class with methods for saving to and loading details from a file. A script demonstrating saving multiple buildings to a file and then reading them back into the program.
3. City Services Simulation: Python OOP and Modular Design
Objective:
This assignment aims to strengthen your skills in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and modular programming by building a simulation of city services. The focus will be on using class variables and organizing code into modules, simulating services like public transportation, park management, and city utilities.

Task 1: Public Transportation Module

Problem Statement: Develop a Bus class as part of a public transportation module. Use class variables to represent common attributes like city name and base fare. Implement instance variables for specific attributes like route number and passenger capacity.
Expected Outcome: A Bus class with both class and instance variables, and a transportation module to manage different bus routes. A test script should demonstrate creating bus instances and accessing both class and instance attributes.
